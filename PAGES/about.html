An e-ticket (electronic ticket) is a paperless electronic document used for ticketing passengers,<br>
 particularly in the commercial railway industry. Virtually all major railways now use this method of ticketing. <br>
When a customer books a ticket by telephone or using the Web, the details of the reservation are stored in a computer. <br>
 The customer can request that a hardcopy confirmation be sent by postal mail, but it is not needed at the check-in desk. <br>
  A confirmation number is assigned to the passenger, along with the train number(s), date(s), departure location(s), <br>
  and destination location(s). When checking in at the train station, the passenger simply presents positive identification. <br>
  Then necessary boarding passes are issued, and the passenger can check luggage and proceed through security to the gate area. <br>
The principal advantage of e-ticketing is the fact that it reduces booking expense by eliminating the need for <br>
 printing and mailing paper documents. Another advantage is that it eliminates the possibility of critical documents getting <br>
  lost in the mail or being sent to the wrong address. <br>
